# spotifybutler

Intent here is to build something out to create dynamic playlists to do things like "here are songs you like that
aren't in your top songs" or "here are songs you liked that aren't in the last 50 you played."

I'd love to do fancier queries than those two, like iTunes smart playlists, but the Spotify API doesn't support getting
more than just that. I wish it would give me "last play time" and "total play count" for a user/track, but don't see
that in their API, and the feature requests are old and stale.
